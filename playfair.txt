Overview

This script implements the Playfair Cipher, a manual symmetric encryption cipher invented in 1854 by Charles Wheatstone. The cipher encrypts digraphs (pairs of two letters) instead of single letters. The script contains functions for key table generation, position finding in the key table, encryption and decryption of letter pairs, and main functions for encryption and decryption of messages using the Playfair Cipher.
Functions
generate_key_table(key)

This function generates a 5x5 key table using a specified key.


Parameters:

    key (str): The key used to generate the key table.

Returns:

    (list): The 5x5 key table generated from the key.




find_position(key_table, char)

This function finds the position of a character in the key table.
Parameters:

    key_table (list): The 5x5 key table.
    char (str): The character to find.

Returns:

    (tuple): A tuple containing the row and column indices of the character in the key table.




encrypt_pair(key_table, a, b)

This function encrypts a pair of characters using the key table.
Parameters:

    key_table (list): The 5x5 key table.
    a (str): The first character of the pair.
    b (str): The second character of the pair.

Returns:

    (str): The encrypted pair of characters.




decrypt_pair(key_table, a, b)

This function decrypts a pair of characters using the key table.
Parameters:

    key_table (list): The 5x5 key table.
    a (str): The first character of the pair.
    b (str): The second character of the pair.

Returns:

    (str): The decrypted pair of characters.



encrypt_playfair(text, key)

This function encrypts a text using the Playfair Cipher and a specified key.
Parameters:

    text (str): The text to encrypt.
    key (str): The key used to encrypt the text.

Returns:

    (str): The encrypted text.



decrypt_playfair(ciphertext, key)

This function decrypts a ciphertext using the Playfair Cipher and a specified key.
Parameters:

    ciphertext (str): The ciphertext to decrypt.
    key (str): The key used to decrypt the ciphertext.

Returns:

    (str): The decrypted text.



Execution

The script provides a main execution block that demonstrates encryption and decryption using the Playfair Cipher. To use the script, simply modify the text and key variables in the main execution block, then run the script. The script will print the encrypted and decrypted text to the console.

Examples

Execution

python <script-name.py>


In this example, replace <script-name.py> with the name of the script file. Upon execution, the script will output the encrypted and decrypted text using the specified text and key values in the main execution block.
Output

plaintext

Encrypted text: <encrypted-text>
Decrypted text: HELLO

In the output, <encrypted-text> will be the result of encrypting the text value using the Playfair Cipher and the specified key.
